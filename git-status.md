"Definition: git status"

The command "git status," when typed in the terminal, shows in which branch one is working and displays which files are staged, unstages, and untracked.

To acomplish this in the JupyterLab IDE, click on the "Git" extension button on the Left sidebar and in the resulting window click on the "Changes" button.
