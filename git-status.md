"Definition: git status"

The git status command shows which files are staged, unstaged, and tracked. It also lists the current branch.
To do this using the LupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal one must click on the "Git" extension icon on the left sidebar and select the "Changes" tab within the resulting left sidebar.
